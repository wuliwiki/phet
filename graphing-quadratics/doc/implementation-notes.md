# Graphing Quadratics - implementation notes

This document contains notes related to the implementation of Graphing Quadratic. This is not an exhaustive description of the implementation.  The intention is to provide a high-level overview, and to supplement the internal documentation (source code comments) and external documentation (design document).  

The audience for this document is software developers who are familiar with JavaScript and PhET simulation development, as described in [PhET Development Overview](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/master/doc/phet-development-overview.md).  The reader should also be familiar with general design patterns used in PhET simulations.

Before reading this document, see [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/doc/model.md), which provides a high-level description of the simulation model.

You may also wish to review the [Graphing Quadratics design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wgxqGIhs37BLamT2Kpqnm1pswbrM4i6Hd9edGy3bNCg/edit), but be forewarned that it is out of date.

## Terminology

This section defines terminology that you'll see used throughout the internal and external documentation.  There's no need to memorize this section; skim it once, refer back to it as you explore the implementation.

Standard terminology:

* axis of symmetry - vertical line that intersects the vertex
* constant term - the _c_ term of _y_ = _ax_<sup>2</sup> + _bx_ + _c_
* curve - generalization of a line, whose curvature need not be zero (geometric definition)
* directrix - a fixed horizontal line used in describing a curve or surface
* focus - a fixed point on the interior of a parabola, used in the formal definition of the curve
* line - a straight curve (geometric definition)
* linear term - the _bx_ term of _y_ = _ax_<sup>2</sup> + _bx_ + _c_
* parabola - a plane curve generated by a point moving so that its distance from a fixed point (focus) is equal to its distance from a fixed line (directrix)
* quadratic - short for "quadratic equation", in any of the 3 supported forms
* quadratic term - the _ax_<sup>2</sup> term of _y_ = _ax_<sup>2</sup> + _bx_ + _c_
* roots - or real roots, zero or more point(s) where a polynomial intersects the x axis
* standard form - see [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/doc/model.md)
* vertex - the highest or lowest point of a parabola, also it's turning point
* vertex form - see [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/doc/model.md)

PhET-specific terminology:

* alternative vertex form - see [model.md](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/doc/model.md)
* erase button - button with an eraser icon, used to erase the saved curve
* graph contents - everything that is displayed on the graph, excluding the grid and axes
* 'hide graph contents' button - button with an eyeball icon that shows/hides the graph contents
* interactive quadratic - the quadratic that the user can interact with, via sliders, pickers, and/or manipulators
* manipulator - shaded sphere that appears on the graph, used to change some aspect of the interactive quadratic
* saved curve - the saved state of the interactive quadratic, appears on the graph as a gray line
* save button - button with a camera icon, used to create the saved curve

## Common Patterns

This section describes how this simulation uses patterns that are common to PhET simulations.

**Model-view transform**: This simulation has a model-view transform that maps from the graph (model) coordinate frame to the view coordinate frame. The origin (0,0) in the model coordinate frame is (not surprisingly) at the origin of the graph.

**Query parameters**: Query parameters are used to enable sim-specific features, mainly for debugging and
testing. Sim-specific query parameters are documented in
[GQQueryParameters](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/GQQueryParameters.js).

**Assertions**: The implementation makes liberal use of `assert` to verify pre/post assumptions and perform argument validation. If you are making modifications to this sim, do so with assertions enabled via the `ea` query parameter.

**Memory management**: Unless otherwise documented in the source code, assume that `unlink`, `removeListener`, `dispose`, etc. are generally not needed. Most object instances exist for the lifetime of the sim. The exception is `QuadraticNode` for the saved curve.

## Related simulations

This sim reuses a very small number of model and view components from Graphing Lines. Search for "GRAPHING_LINES/" to identify what is reused.

## Model

This section provides an overview of the most important model components.

Note that this simulation supports _only_ parabolas that open up or down, i.e. have the form _y_ = _ax_<sup>2</sup> + _bx_ + _c_.  It does not support parabolas that open left or right, i.e. that have the form _x_ = _ay_<sup>2</sup> + _by_ + _c_.

[Quadratic](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/model/Quadratic.js) is the primary model component. It is essentially an immutable data structure that describes a quadratic equation. It supports instantiation using standard form (via the constructor), vertex form (via `createFromVertexForm`) and alternate vertex form (via `createFromAlternateVertexForm`).

[GQModel](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/model/GQModel.js) is the base class for all model "containers".  It includes the model components that are common to all screens.  Each screen has a subclass of `GQModel` that adds things that are specific to that screen. For example, [ExploreModel](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/explore/model/ExploreModel.js) is the model container for the _Explore_ screen.

## View

This section provides an overview of the most important view components.

[QuadraticNode](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/QuadraticNode.js) is the primary view component, responsible for rendering the curve that corresponds to a `Quadratic` instance, and labeling the curve with an equation. While `QuadraticNode` is responsible for the placement of the equation relative to the curve, [GQEquationFactory](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/GQEquationFactory.js) is responsible for creation of equations.

[GQScreenView](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/GQScreenView.js) is the base class for all ScreenViews in this sim. It includes the view components that are common to all screens, and it handles common layout responsibilities. Each screen has a subclass of `GQScreenView` that adds things that are specific to that screen. For example, [ExploreScreenView](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/explore/view/ExploreScreenView.js) is the view for the _Explore_ screen.

[GQGraphNode](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/GQGraphNode.js) is the base class for all graphs in this sim. Each screen has a subclass of `GQGraphNode` that adds things that are specific to that screen. For example, [ExploreGraphNode](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/explore/view/ExploreGraphNode.js) is the graph for the _Explore_ screen.

[GQEquationAccordionBox](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/GQEquationAccordionBox.js) is the base class for the accordion box that displays the interactive quadratic. Each screen has a subclass of EquationAccordionBox that adds things that are specific to that screen. (Do you see a pattern here? :wink:) For example, [ExploreEquationAccordionBox](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/explore/view/ExploreEquationAccordionBox.js) is the equation accordion box for the _Explore_ screen.

Each screen has a class whose name ends with "InteractiveEquationNode", for example, [ExploreInteractiveEquationNode](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/explore/view/ExploreInteractiveEquationNode.js). This is the UI for modifying the interactive quadratic indirectly, using sliders or pickers. _Explore_ and _Focus & Directrix_ screens use sliders, _Standard Form_ and _Vertex Form_ screens use pickers.

Manipulators are the shaded spheres that appear on the graph. They allow the user to modify the interactive quadratic directly, by interacting with its curve. The [Manipulator](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-lines/blob/master/js/common/view/manipulator/Manipulator.js) base class is reused from the Graphing Lines sim, and is extended in the [GQManipulator](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/GQManipulator.js) base class, which adds optional (x,y) coordinates.  The 3 subclasses of `GQManipulator` are [VertexManipulator](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/VertexManipulator.js), [FocusManipulator](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/focusanddirectrix/view/FocusManipulator.js) and [PointOnParabolaManipulator](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/focusanddirectrix/view/PointOnParabolaManipulator.js), for changing the vertex, focus, and point on the parabola, respectively.

Each checkbox in this sim is a subclass of [GQCheckBox](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/view/GQCheckbox.js), a subtype of `SUN/Checkbox` that supports labeling with an optional icon, and provides standardization of various properties (font, fill,...) You can locate a `Checkbox` subclass based on the English text used on checkbox. For example, [FocusCheckbox](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/focusanddirectrix/view/FocusCheckbox.js) is the checkbox labeled with "Focus" and a focus manipulator icon.
