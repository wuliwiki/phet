# Graphing Quadratics - model description

Different screens use different forms of the quadratic equation.

_Explore_ and _Standard Form_ screens use **standard form** (sometimes referred to as general form):

_y_ = _ax_<sup>2</sup> + _bx_ + _c_

_Vertex Form_ screen uses **vertex form**, where (_h_, _k_) is the vertex:

_y_ = _a_(_x_ - _h_)<sup>2</sup> + _k_

_Focus & Directrix_ screen uses an **alternative vertex form**, where _a_ is replaced with 1/(4 _p_ ), and _p_ is the equidistance of the vertex from the focus and directrix.

_y_ = (1/(4 _p_))(_x_ - _h_)<sup>2</sup> + _k_

See [Quadratic.js](https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-quadratics/blob/master/js/common/model/Quadratic.js) for the implementation, which supports all 3 forms.
