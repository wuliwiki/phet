# Graphing Slope-Intercept - implementation notes

This simulation is a subset of the Graphing Lines simulation. It includes the "Slope-Intercept" screen, and a modified
"Line Game" screen that uses only slope-intercept form.

For details on the implementation of Graphing Lines,
see https://github.com/phetsims/graphing-lines/blob/master/doc/implementation-notes.md.
