# Sound - model description

## Waves

All screens in this simulation contain speakers that will emit sound waves that will propagate throughout the screen in
a conical shape. When the waves propagate their intensity will decrease the further they get away from the source up
until a certain distance, after which they fade out completely. The frequency and initial amplitude of the waves can be
set using the sliders in the user interface.

The wave areas in each screen represent an area with a width and height of 10 meter.

The waves represent sound waves and thus have speed of 343 m/s.

The frequency of the waves can be set to be between 0 and 1000 Hz.

The amplitude of the waves can be set to be between 0 and 10 Hz.

## Measure screen

This screen has two extra components: a meter stick that is 5 meter long, and a stopwatch component that measures the time in ms.

## Two source screen

This screen contains two speakers, one of which is movable, and thus shows the interference pattern produced by the two
sound waves overlapping.

## Reflection Screen

This screen has a movable wall that will reflect the wave back. The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of
reflection. After the reflection wave will then interfere with itself.

## Pressure Screen

This screen will have the speaker be contained in a box in which the air pressure is controllable. The intensity of the
waves will be linearly equivalent to the air pressure. The pressure can vary between 0 and 1 ATM.
