# pH Scale: Basics - Implementation Notes

This simulation consists of the _Macro_ screen from the _pH Scale_ simulation.
The sole differences is that (by default) the beaker does not automatically fill with
solute when the sim starts up, or when the Solute combo box selection is changed.
This behavior can be changed with the `autofill` query parameter.

Please
see [ph-scale/doc/implementation-notes.md](https://github.com/phetsims/ph-scale/blob/master/doc/implementation-notes.md)
for details.
