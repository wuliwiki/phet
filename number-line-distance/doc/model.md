# Number Line: Distance - Model Description

@author Saurabh Totey

## Overview

The main concept in this simulation is subtraction as distance between two points on a number line. The user controls two 'controllers', that, once attached to the number line, have their distance presented on a number line. Distances can be presented either in absolute form or directed form. Absolute distance is represented on the number line with a shaded line whereas directed distance is represented on the number line with a shaded arrow. Absolute distance will always be positive, as it is the absolute value of the difference between x<sub>2</sub> and x<sub>1</sub>. Directed distance will be either positive or negative, depending on the values of x<sub>2</sub> and x<sub>1</sub>. x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> can be swapped by clicking a button at the bottom left of the interface.

## The "Distance" Scene

In this scene, the user can place the house and person on the sidewalk, and the distance between them will be represented on the number line.

## The "Temperature" Scene

In this scene, the user can place thermometers in the play area, and the difference in temperature is represented on the number line. The right side of the play area represents hot temperatures and the left side accordingly represents cold temperatures.

## The "Elevation" Scene

In this scene, the user can place the bird and fish in the play area, and the difference in their vertical position is represented on the number line.

## The "Generic" Screen

On this screen, the user can place generic controllers on the number line and the difference in their position is represented on the number line. The orientation of the number line (vertical vs. horizontal) can be changed, as can the number line's range.
