# Masses and Springs: Basics - implementation notes

This simulation is a subset of the Masses and Springs simulation. It includes most of the features from MAS and uses a boolean flag (`basicsVersion`) to determine what should be implemented in the basics version. 

MASB exludes the use of an energy graph and a toolbox on the Stretch and Bounce screens. The Stretch screen also uses a set of springs with a discrete damping value applied. Options for adjusting the spring system have been limited to only gravity values on the lab screen.
