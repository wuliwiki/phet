For this simulation, the location of a model shape is defined as the left
bottom of the shape.

In the Explore tab, all shapes are created initially and added to both the
model and view, and their visibility is changed to make them appear and
disappear.

Properties are named with the suffix 'Property', e.g. positionProperty.
