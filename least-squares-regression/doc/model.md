## Description of the model used in least-squares regression

The model uses a standard least squares approach to determine the 'best fit line'
of a series of data points. A residual is the difference between the measured Y
value of a data point and the value provided by a linear fit. A squared residual
is merely the square value of a residual. The best fit line is determined by
minimizing the sum of the squared residuals.

The r value, also known as the Pearson correlation coefficient or Pearson product
moment correlation coefficient, ranges from -1 to 1 and is a measured of the
correlation between the X and Y variables. In our model the r value is
calculated using the definition of the sample Pearson correlation coefficient
(as opposed to the population Pearson correlation coefficient).
