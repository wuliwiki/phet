# Function Builder: Basics - implementation notes

This simulation is a subset of the Function Builder simulation. It includes the "Patterns" screen, 
and a modified "Mystery" screen that uses patterns (images) instead of numbers.

Files for the Mystery screen have a 'FBB' prefix (for "Function Builder: Basics") to distinguish them from
similar files in Function Builder.

For details on the implementation of Function Builder,
see https://github.com/phetsims/function-builder/blob/master/doc/implementation-notes.md.
