## Inverse Square Law
Coulomb's law is one of two inverse square laws that defines the force that two charges will exert upon each other.

F = k( q1 * q2 / d<sup>2</sup>)

Note: See the [Inverse Square Law Common](https://github.com/phetsims/inverse-square-law-common/blob/master/doc/model.md) library for model details.

## Macro Scale

Applies to a visual scale where the charges are ~1cm in diameter. When calculating the force, we use each charge's center when measuring distance.

## Atomic Scale

Applies to a more realistic scale in which the charges are ~1pm in diameter and charge is measured in atomic units.
